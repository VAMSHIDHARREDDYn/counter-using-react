# Simple Counter App Using React

This is a basic Counter application built using **React Class Components**.  
It demonstrates the ability to manage **state**, handle **events**, and update the user interface dynamically.

## âœ… What this app does:
- Displays a counter value on the screen.
- Increases or decreases the counter value when clicking the respective buttons.

## ðŸš€ Why I built this:
As a fresher learning React, I wanted to create a simple project to practice:
- Working with class components.
- Managing component state with `this.setState()`.
- Handling user events like button clicks.
- Creating a clean, responsive layout using basic CSS.

## âš¡ How to run the app:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
Navigate to the project folder:
cd your-repo-name
Install dependencies:
npm install
Start the development server:
npm start
Open http://localhost:3000
 in your browser to see the app in action.
